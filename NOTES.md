#### LD38 - A small world ####

# Planet of Babel #

A planet is shared by aliens / shipwrecks of all worlds and cultures (realtime multiplayer). They cannot understand each other, but to succeed, they must cooperate.

The gameplay is turn-based and consists of trying to control and maintain territories, gathering resources, defending and attacking other players. There is a karma system, which punishes people for attacking newcomers and people with good karma, while rewarding them for helping and sharing and attacking people with bad karma. Retribution is delivered by "gods".

The ultimate goal of the game is to build a tower. This consists of putting in immense amounts of resources. These can be stolen by other players, who can try to build the tower on their own. Leaderboards motivator?

The gameplay has a slower pace, but it keeps running in the background. Encourage players to connect more than once?
